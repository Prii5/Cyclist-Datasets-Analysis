# Cyclist Datasets Analysis

The goal of this case study was to analyze how casual and annual members of Cyclistic-- a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago-- use bikes differently. Through the insights, the marketing team would design a new strategy to convert casual riders into members.

## Findings I: Rides by Month
The casual riders are more active during the summer, the rides in general are low during the winter

## Findings III: Rides by Busiest Station

Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Michigan Ave & Oak St, Wells St & Concord Ln, Millennium Park, and Clark St & Elm St are the most busiest stations for the company. Analyzing rides originating from these five peak statations shows that there are more casual riders in these stations than member riders.
